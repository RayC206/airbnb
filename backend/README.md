# airbnb
Week 11 First Portfolio Project


#Personal notes: 

What was the most challenging part of this project for you?
 * Researching syntax 
 * Creating validators
 * Making sure migrations / models / seeders working correctly
 * Table Associations
 
What part of your work on the project are you most proud of?
 * I am proud of creating error handlers with try catch, since it made my code alot cleaner looking. 
 * Seeing the proper response on the server
 
What are some parts you would like to go back and improve and/or minor bugs you would like to clean up?
 * There were parts where the code could be cleaner, I should of made a middleware to handle all of my errors to make my code cleaner to look at.
